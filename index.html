	<h3 class="question">Reason you applied for aid</h3>
	<code class="answers">I am a resident of India and i am a student and don't have any special source of income. 
	I totally rely on my father for my college fees and pocket money and other monthly expenditure and my scholarship which i am getting from National Scholarship Portal.
		My father is a daily wage labourer and mother is a housewife.Our annual income is pretty low with respect to the average nationals income. 
		I think it will be beneficial for me to get into the firm as an intern. 
		So, my father took an education loan for my graduation expenses. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. 
		Financial assistance will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. 
		So, I am badly in need of this financial aid. I cannot afford to buy the course alongside my monthly expenses and college fees. 
		I would be happy to get financial help. Receiving this Financial assistance will open for me a new horizon of the world of coursera courses, 
		which in turn will help me in the future. I also plan to complete all assignments on or before time. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums,
		which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the online courses I have taken on Coursera. 
		I also plan to grade assignments, which are to peer-reviewed, which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity</code>
